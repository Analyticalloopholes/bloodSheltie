blood-sheltie
=============

This is a remake of [blood-shepherd](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/blood-shepher), a sync api and rough client to extract data from the [Dexcom Platinum G4](http://dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum) receiver.

This is a Objective-C library meant to support applications that would want to consume Dexcom data and do something useful in some way. 

This is still a work-in-progress but the important pieces of functionality are there.
