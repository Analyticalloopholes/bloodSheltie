blood-sheltie
=============

This is a remake of [blood-shepherd](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/blood-shepher(), a sync api and rough client to extract data from the [Dexcom Platinum G4](http://dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum) receiver.

This follows the exploration phase of [blood-shepherd](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/blood-shepherd) to try and create a Objective-C library that will serve as the foundation for a proper Cocoa Status bar app.
